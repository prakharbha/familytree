1. Introduction and Project Overview

1.1 Purpose of This Document
This MVP Requirements Document defines the scope, functionality, user experience expectations, and foundational principles for the first build of the platform (project name TBD). The purpose is to provide developers and designers with a clear, unambiguous, detailed guide to build the initial version of the product without guesswork or missing context.
This document outlines what needs to be built, how it should function, and the experience it must deliver to reflect the core vision of the platform.
The MVP is not aiming to capture every feature of the long-term vision. Instead, it must successfully demonstrate three core truths:
This is not social media.
It is reflective, intimate, and private.
This is not genealogy software.
It is about human stories, emotions, and identity — not just names and dates.
This is not cloud storage.
It is structured, contextual, and deeply meaningful, not a dump of files.

1.2 Product Vision (High-Level)
The platform is designed to help individuals and families connect more deeply, understand one another more fully, and preserve meaningful stories, memories, values, and cultural heritage across generations.
Unlike social media or genealogy tools, this platform focuses on: - Emotional depth (why moments matter) - Family connection (strengthening bonds) - Identity understanding (multi-dimensional personas) - Generational continuity (preserving culture + lineage)
The goal is to create a private, reflective digital space where each person’s story is honored as part of a larger family tapestry.

1.3 Problem Statement
Modern families are increasingly disconnected despite digital connectivity. Lives are documented through social feeds and fragmented platforms, but: 
Meaning is lost in the noise. 
Stories aren’t preserved. 
Cultural roots fade. 
Younger generations don’t understand the lives, struggles, and values of their parents or grandparents. 
Older generations lack a simple way to pass down wisdom or secure important information.
The platform solves these gaps by creating a centralized, private, emotionally rich family ecosystem.


1.4 MVP Objective
The MVP aims to establish the core foundation of this ecosystem by enabling users to capture meaningful memories and build a living timeline. It provides an avenue to Celebrate key milestones, Preserve private items securely and Map family relationships. For next generation, the solution allows understanding of one's identity through personas and culture, and build deeper intergenerational relatability 
The MVP positions the product as a “Legacy Over Lifetime” platform — a new category that bridges the gap between:
Memory keeping
Family storytelling
Identity reflection
Generational continuity
Digital inheritance
It provides the user with a sense of continuity, connection, and emotional resonance from Day 
The MVP is not meant to include advanced automation or AI generation—only a clear, guided, structured experience using predefined prompts and standard programming logic.




1.5 Product Themes (What the MVP Must Demonstrate)
The MVP must successfully demonstrate the following themes:
1. Connection
Bring families closer by enabling shared memories, reflections, and insights.
2. Continuity
Preserve cultural roots, traditions, values, and life lessons.
3. Identity
Show each user as a whole person across multiple dimensions.
4. Meaning
Focus on reflection, lessons, and emotional significance—not social performance.
5. Privacy
Private by default. Family-first access controls.

What the MVP Must Communicate Immediately
       Within the first 5 minutes of use, the user should feel:
“This is a place to preserve who I am, not just what I’ve done.”
“This feels private, safe, and personal — not performative.”
“This helps me think, remember, and reflect — not just share.”
“I can build something meaningful for my family.”
“AI here isn’t gimmicky — it understands me and helps me articulate my story.”


1.5 Core Differentiators

This section identifies the unique value drivers that set this platform apart from every adjacency: social media, genealogy platforms, photo storage, journaling tools, and digital inheritance services.
These differentiators must be visible in the MVP, not just the long-term roadmap.

1. Legacy Over a Lifetime (Category Breaker)
Instead of a static record of the past or a feed of the moment, the platform introduces a new category:
A living, evolving legacy that grows with you.
Traditional genealogy tells where you came from. Social media shows what you’re doing now. Legacy platforms (wills, vaults, etc.) only matter when you're gone.
This bridges all three.
It creates a complete, emotional, identity-rich picture of a person as they live, grow, reflect, and evolve.
This concept powers everything else on the platform.

2. The Human Story Layer (Not Just Data)
Most platforms capture information — but not meaning.
Here, every memory, milestone, or achievement includes:
why it mattered
what it taught
who it affected
how it felt
what future generations should understand about it
This transforms content into legacy.
Meaning > Moments Reflection > Posting Story > Status
This philosophical shift is a core differentiator of your platform.
3. Multi-Dimensional Identity (The Six Personas)
Users are not a single face or role — they are six overlapping identities:
Personal
Professional
Social
Generational
Spiritual
Cultural
No existing product organizes a person’s life this holistically.
This affects:
Memory Capsule categorization
Legacy Wall structure
Prompt personalization
Highlight Reel editing
AI suggestions
It creates a 3D representation of a human life.


4. The Wall–Vault Duality (Public Meaning vs Private Truth)
This is a strong conceptual differentiator.
**Legacy Wall = Celebrated, shared, proud moments
Legacy Vault = Protected, conditional, deeply private truths**
No social app or genealogy or journaling system offers this dual-mode structure.
It mirrors how real people live:
Some things belong on the “wall”
Some things belong in the “vault”
This duality will instantly signal:  “Ah — this is not social media.”



5. Memory Capsules as the Atomic Unit
Not posts. Not photos. Not notes. Not media dumps.
Capsules represent:
a moment
a feeling
a lesson
a story
an intent
a voice note
a reflection
Everything in the system builds from this one unified object.
This makes the platform:
easier to design
easier to scale
emotionally consistent
semantically powerful for AI
Capsules give you a “product language” that nobody else has.


6. AI as a Gentle, Reflective Story Guide
	(AI capability will be assessed based on effort required)
AI is not a content generator.
It is:
a prompt engine
a meaning extractor
a story weaver
a curator of threads
a reflection amplifier
This AI philosophy is rare and immediately differentiating.
Examples of AI nudges:
“Why was this moment meaningful to you?”
“Did this event strengthen any of your values?”
“Would you like to add a lesson for your future family?”
“I spotted a milestone — should this go on your Legacy Wall?”
“You uploaded 30 photos from 1998 — want help creating a Memory Capsule?”
AI becomes part of the emotional UX, not a gimmick.

7. Collaborative, Multi-Voice Memories (Relationship Echoes)
A memory becomes a shared story:
Others can add:
their angle
their feelings
their photos
their lessons
their memory of you from that moment
This creates a tapestry of perspectives.
This is rare and deeply human.


8. Private Family Network (Not Public, Not Social Media)
No likes. No followers. No broadcasting. No algorithm chasing.
Everything is:
private-by-default
invite-only
family-rooted
consent-driven
This builds trust, which is a differentiator in itself.



9. Emotion-First Navigation (Not Feed-Driven)
The system nudges users to explore:
their timeline
their values
their ancestry
their life lessons
their roles
their relationships
This is cognitively opposite from feed-based platforms.
The experience feels like exploring:
a scrapbook
a museum
a personal documentary
This is entirely different from scrolling.

10. Connection to the Past, Present, and Future
The MVP subtly supports all three temporal dimensions:
Past: ancestry, values, lineage
Present: stories, achievements, reflections
Future: vault items, messages, instructions, wisdom
This temporal wholeness makes the product feel like a family legacy ecosystem, not a single-purpose tool.


11. Emotional Tone & Voice (Brand Differentiator)
Your product speaks with:
dignity
warmth
reflection
humanity
The tone is part of your differentiation.
Even without Section 8 (UX/UI Principles), the underlying emotional voice is already defined here: Calming, meaningful, not performative.


12. Identity, Memory & Continuity
Combining:
personas
capsules
wall + vault
timeline
family tree
…creates a uniqueness no existing category has attempted.
You’re not competing with genealogy or social media.
You're redefining digital legacy.


 1.6 Out of Scope (For MVP)
The following are not included in the MVP, but may be added later: 
AI-generated summaries or auto-detection 
Public sharing 
Complex genealogy tools 
Recommendation algorithms 
Advanced analytics
TBD 
Social media imports (Facebook/LinkedIn) 

1.7 Terminology
To standardize language used across design/dev: 
Memory Capsule — A structured memory entry containing story, media, emotions. 
Legacy Wall — Public-facing (family-circle) achievements and milestones. - 
Legacy Vault — Private, encrypted item storage. 
Timeline — Chronological life story view. 
Personas — Six-dimension identity model. 
Family Feed — Private updates. 
Family Tree — Relationship mapping. 
Life Tapestry — 360° identity visualization (included in MVP). 
Cultural Heritage / Tradition Tracker — Cultural rituals, traditions, customs (included in MVP).

1.8 Success Criteria for MVP
The MVP is considered successful if: 
Users can create accounts, build profiles, and add memories.
Users can build a family tree and invite others. 
Users can create memory capsules and view them on a timeline. 
Users can create wall items and vault items. 
Users can view a simple Life Tapestry visualization. 
Users can add cultural traditions. 
The experience is intuitive, warm, calm, and private. 
The system is stable and secure.

1.9 Target Audience
Adults ages 25–50 building digital legacies.
Older family members ages 50–80 familiar with basic digital interactions.
Younger adults (Gen Z) exploring family history.

1.10 Platforms (MVP)
Responsive Web App (desktop-first, mobile-friendly)
Mobile apps (iOS/Android) are out of scope for MVP.

1.11 Summary
The MVP establishes the core user journey: - Join → Build Profile → Add Memories → Map Family → Create Wall/Vault → Reflect
This creates a strong base for future layers like AI, automation, social imports, and advanced storytelling tools.
